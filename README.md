- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My nanme is Shalom. On the interwebs Iâ€™m @shaomollo (or @shalahomie).
- ðŸŒ± I completed my BA at Columbia University where I concentrated in Psychology & Public Health
- ðŸ§¬ My interests lie in bioinformatics. In 2024, I'll began a MSc in Computer Science @ Queen's with a focus in AI. Before that, I'll be doing research, going on long bike rides, and hitting the slopes every weekend until the snow melts. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at shalom@omollo.ca
